2024.01.10 We had a successful Center for Aerosol Science and Technology (CAST) Workshop! This is the second time we are hosting this annual workshop at the University of Miami. Around ninety participants joined us in person and virtually. 

2023.10.13 Weixing will have a four-month visit to the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to work on analyzing atmospheric aerosol data and optimizing the working conditions of condensation particle counters. 

2023.09.15 Weixing and Chanakya received the travel grant from AAAR to attend the 41st AAAR Annual Conference! They will also contribute to AAAR as the student volunteers and judges in the conference!

2023.06.10 PMTL gave three platform presentations and three poster presentations at the upcoming AAAR meeting in Portland! Topics will cover CPC optimization, incipient particle measurement, electronic cigarette aerosols, and remote aerosol measurement and data analysis. 

2023.04.07 PMTL attended the Air Pollution Workshop at the University in Florida hosted by Dr. Myoseon Jang. Weixing, Chanakya, Marcus, and Kapiamba gave platform and poster presentations at the workshop.

2023.01.18 It was great interacting with everyone at our 1st  1st Center for Aerosol Science and Technology (CAST) workshop at UM! 

2022.10.07 PMTL had a great show at the 40th Annual Conference of the American Association for Aerosol Research (AAAR) in Raleigh, NC. Weixing, Chanakya, and Kapiamba presented their work on size-dependent bioaerosol-UV interactions, combustion ion measurements, and electronic cigarette aerosol characterizations

2022.05.10 Weixing’s work, “A filter-based system mimicking the particle deposition and penetration in human respiratory system for secondhand smoke generation and characterization” has been published in Inhalation Toxicology, congratulations!

2021.10.21 Weixing, Kapiamba, and Chanakya gave four presentations at the 2021 AAAR conference. Links to their presentations can be found on our group’s Youtube channel.

2021.7.8 Weixing’s paper on simulating laminar flow CPC is published in Journal of Aerosol Science!

2020.12.24 Weixing’s paper “Factors Influencing the Filtration Performance of Homemade Face Masks,” was published by  J. Occup. Environ. Health.!

2020.10.6 Weixing presented a poster titled “Filtration Performances of Non-medical Materials as Candidates for Homemade Face Mask Filters” during the 2020 AAAR virtual conference.

2020.8.24 i worked with undergradute students Brandon and Clayton also joined us as undergraduate researchers. They will work on evaluating the performance of air filters and face shields in blocking airborne particles.

2020.7.21 Our paper evaluating the filtration performance of common household materials is published in International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. Congrats, Weixing!

2020.4.13 Given the COVID-19 situation and the urgent need for medical masks, we will test a wide range of household materials and common commercial fabrics that can be used to manufacture masks. The results were updated daily on google sheet: https://www.tinyurl.com/ve28f3l

2020.4.10 Our recent efforts on evaluating the filtration efficiencies of non-medical materials as candidates for homemade mask filters were reported by multiple news platforms such as [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-homemade-mask-material-DIY-face-mask-ppe.html), [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200504-coronavirus-what-is-the-best-kind-of-face-mask), [NPR News](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/04/22/840146830/adding-a-nylon-stocking-layer-could-boost-protection-from-cloth-masks-study-find), [C&EN News](https://cen.acs.org/materials/Scientists-take-closer-look-materials/98/i25), [Daily Herald](https://www.dailyherald.com/news/20200407/what-makes-for-a-good-homemade-face-mask/), [Today](https://www.today.com/style/what-type-fabric-best-face-masks-t179615), [Newsy](https://scrippsnews.com/stories/which-diy-masks-actually-work/), etc.
 
2019.10.19 I gave a poster presentation at the 24th Annual Mid-American Environmental & Engineering Conference (MAEEC) at the University of Missouri on “Enhancing the detection efficiency of sub 3 nm aerosols with a modified condensation particle counter”.
