Hello! Welcome to my space! I'm Weixing, a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the [University of Miami](https://welcome.miami.edu/), specifically within the [Department of Chemical, Environmental, and Materials Engineering](https://ceme.coe.miami.edu/index.html), [College of Engineering](https://www.coe.miami.edu/). My academic journey is guided by the expertise of [Dr. Yang Wang](https://people.miami.edu/profile/dec102c8f8ba6c48c281dd2300d0f707), and I spend most of my research hours in the [Particle Measurement & Technology Laboratory (PMTL)](https://pmtl.coe.miami.edu/index.html). I am also an active member of the [Center for Aerosol Science and Technology (CAST)](https://cast.miami.edu/) in the University of Miami.

2020.4.10 Our recent efforts on evaluating the filtration efficiencies of non-medical materials as candidates for homemade mask filters were reported by multiple news platforms such as [New York](Timeshttps://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-homemade-mask-material-DIY-face-mask-ppe.html), [BBC News(https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200504-coronavirus-what-is-the-best-kind-of-face-mask), [NPR News](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/04/22/840146830/adding-a-nylon-stocking-layer-could-boost-protection-from-cloth-masks-study-find), [C&EN News](https://cen.acs.org/materials/Scientists-take-closer-look-materials/98/i25), [Daily Herald](https://www.dailyherald.com/news/20200407/what-makes-for-a-good-homemade-face-mask/), [Today](https://www.today.com/style/what-type-fabric-best-face-masks-t179615), [Newsy](https://scrippsnews.com/stories/which-diy-masks-actually-work/), etc.

2019.10.19 I gave a poster presentation at the 24th Annual Mid-American Environmental & Engineering Conference (MAEEC) at the University of Missouri on “Enhancing the detection efficiency of sub 3 nm aerosols with a modified condensation particle counter”.
