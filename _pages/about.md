Hello! Welcome to my space! I'm Weixing, a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the [University of Miami](https://welcome.miami.edu/), specifically within the [Department of Chemical, Environmental, and Materials Engineering](https://ceme.coe.miami.edu/index.html), [College of Engineering](https://www.coe.miami.edu/). My academic journey is guided by the expertise of [Dr. Yang Wang](https://people.miami.edu/profile/dec102c8f8ba6c48c281dd2300d0f707), and I spend most of my research hours in the [Particle Measurement & Technology Laboratory (PMTL)](https://pmtl.coe.miami.edu/index.html). I am also an active member of the [Center for Aerosol Science and Technology (CAST)](https://cast.miami.edu/) in the University of Miami.

My work and research
======
My research interests cover diverse aspects of -aerosol- science and engineering, with a focus on the study of aerosols that affect our health and environment. My current research topic focuses on aerosol instrumentation, aerosol characterization and measurements, health-related aerosol mitigation, and indoor environmental behavior of bioaerosols. I have also studied air filtration and occupational health, specifically in filtration performances of non-medical materials as candidates for manufacturing facemasks and respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic.

My research journey has led me to explore critical topics that impact public health and environmental well-being. I am passionate about leveraging scientific insights to address real-world challenges and contribute to advancements in the field.

My personal life
======
- Passionate about traveling, exploring maps, and road trips.
- Enjoys reading, swimming, and fitness activities.

**Welcome aboard!**
