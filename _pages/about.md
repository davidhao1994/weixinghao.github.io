* I'm Weixing, a research assistant at the [University of Miami](https://welcome.miami.edu/), specifically within the [Department of Chemical, Environmental, and Materials Engineering](https://ceme.coe.miami.edu/index.html), [College of Engineering](https://www.coe.miami.edu/) working with [Dr. Yang Wang](https://people.miami.edu/profile/dec102c8f8ba6c48c281dd2300d0f707) at the [Particle Measurement & Technology Laboratory (PMTL)](https://pmtl.coe.miami.edu/index.html).
<!-- I am also an active member of the [Center for Aerosol Science and Technology (CAST)](https://cast.miami.edu/).-->

My work and research
======
* My research interests cover diverse aspects of **aerosol science and engineering**: indoor bioaerosol control, aerosol instrumentation, occupational air filtration, health-related aerosol mitigation, atmospheric aerosols, aerosol characterization and measurements. <!-- New particle formation and prediction -->

* My research on the filtration performance of non-medical materials for facemasks and respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic gained media attention: [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-homemade-mask-material-DIY-face-mask-ppe.html), [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200504-coronavirus-what-is-the-best-kind-of-face-mask), [NPR News](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/04/22/840146830/adding-a-nylon-stocking-layer-could-boost-protection-from-cloth-masks-study-find), [C&EN News](https://cen.acs.org/materials/Scientists-take-closer-look-materials/98/i25), [Daily Herald](https://www.dailyherald.com/news/20200407/what-makes-for-a-good-homemade-face-mask/), [Today](https://www.today.com/style/what-type-fabric-best-face-masks-t179615), [Newsy](https://scrippsnews.com/stories/which-diy-masks-actually-work/), and highlighted on [Missouri S&T's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhckSGPT9Rg&t=1s). The data was shared publicly on [Google Sheets](http://tinyurl.com/59mpr2h9).
