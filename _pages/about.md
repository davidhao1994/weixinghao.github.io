Hello! Welcome to my space! I'm Weixing, a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the [University of Miami](https://welcome.miami.edu/), specifically within the [Department of Chemical, Environmental, and Materials Engineering](https://ceme.coe.miami.edu/index.html), [College of Engineering](https://www.coe.miami.edu/). My academic journey is guided by the expertise of [Dr. Yang Wang](https://people.miami.edu/profile/dec102c8f8ba6c48c281dd2300d0f707), and I spend most of my research hours in the [Particle Measurement & Technology Laboratory (PMTL)](https://pmtl.coe.miami.edu/index.html). I am also an active member of the [Center for Aerosol Science and Technology (CAST)](https://cast.miami.edu/) in the University of Miami.

My work and research
======
My research interests cover diverse aspects of aerosol science and engineering, with a focus on the study of aerosols that affect our health and environment. My current research topic focuses on aerosol instrumentation, aerosol characterization and measurements, health-related aerosol mitigation, and indoor environmental behavior of bioaerosols. I have also studied air filtration and occupational health, specifically in filtration performances of non-medical materials as candidates for manufacturing facemasks and respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic.

My research journey has led me to explore critical topics that impact public health and environmental well-being. I am passionate about leveraging scientific insights to address real-world challenges and contribute to advancements in the field.

##Research Interests: Aerosol and air quality; Air filtration; Aerosol instrumentation; Aerosol health effects; Nanoparticles measurement; Bioaerosols; Occupational health; Inhalation toxicology.

My personal life
======
My life extends beyond the lab and research. When I get out of the house, I engage in my other passions: the thrill of traveling, the joy of browsing maps, and the excitement of embarking on road trips that leave me with unforgettable memories. These adventures ignite my curiosity, deepen my understanding of geography, and inject a unique perspective into my professional work.

But my explorations are not limited to physical travel. I am equally passionate about traveling across the vast expanse of literature and reading books in a variety of genres that transport me to different fields and eras. Reading not only broadens my horizons, but also enriches my understanding of the world and its myriad narratives. In addition, I rejuvenate my mind and body through swimming and fitness routines, preparing me for the challenges and excitement ahead.

**Welcome aboard!**
