Hello! Iâ€™m Weixing, a Ph.D. student at the [University of Miami](https://welcome.miami.edu/) in the [Department of Chemical, Environmental and Materials Engineering](https://ceme.coe.miami.edu/index.html) of [College of Engineering](https://www.coe.miami.edu/) under the guidance of Dr. [Yang Wang](https://people.miami.edu/profile/dec102c8f8ba6c48c281dd2300d0f707) in the [Particle Measurement & Technology Laboratory (PMTL)](https://pmtl.coe.miami.edu/index.html). I am also a part of the [Center for Aerosol Science and Technology (CAST)](https://cast.miami.edu/).

My work and research
======
xxxxxxxx  xxx  xxx files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator

How to edit your site's GitHub repository

Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly
