Filtration performances of household materials as candidates for facemasks.	8/2019 - 10/2021
•	Investigated the filtration performance of common materials for potential use as filters in 3D-printed respirators and DIY facemasks during the COVID-19 pandemic.
•	Determined the factors influencing the filtration performance of homemade face masks.
•	Evaluated the filtration efficiency of over 250 different non-medical and fabric materials and freely shared with the public.
•	Assessed the breathability of each material to ensure user comfort.
•	Achieved similar N95 filtration efficiency using multiple layers of household air filters without significant flow resistance increase.
•	Recommended manufacturing homemade facemasks with a combination of fibrous and fabric materials to guarantee the sufficient removal of aerosols.
•	Determined that washing and drying showed good reusability for fabric materials.
•	Boosted filtration performance with triboelectric charging, but its fleeting effect due to charge dissipation suggests limited utility in homemade face coverings.
•	Captured significant media attention from leading outlets such as the New York Times, BBC News, NPR News, etc.
•	Technologies Utilized: Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer; Aerodynamic Particle Sizer; Condensation particle Counter; Constant Output Atomizer; Air Sampling Cassette; Scanning Electron Microscope; Manometer; Digital Microscope.
Model simulation of laminar flow Condensation Particle Counters (CPC).	8/2019 - 5/2023
•	Examined the performance of alcohol-based and water-based CPCs through numerical simulation.
•	Understood the effects of varying operating conditions (temperature, flow rate, inlet pressure, geometry) and working fluids on CPC performance.
•	Employed COMSOL software for comprehensive numerical simulations of CPCs and post-processing of MATLAB.
•	Incorporated particle activation and droplet growth within the simulations.
•	Identified that lowering the condenser temperature, reducing the diameter of the condenser tube and using a lower aerosol flow rate through the capillary can enhance the activation of sub-3 nm particles.
•	Observed that droplet growth reduction becomes pronounced under low-pressure scenarios, potentially impacting counting efficiency.
•	Offered insights beneficial for future adjustments and enhancements in CPCs tailored to sub-3 nm particle detection.
•	Provided guidance for optimizing vWCPC performance, especially for precise particle detection and atmospheric aerosol monitoring.
•	Technologies Utilized: COMSOL Multiphysics simulation coupled with MATLAB.
 
Understanding the evolution and transport of indoor bioaerosols.	9/2020 - 10/2024
•	Understand the viability of bioaerosols based on their sizes in indoor environments, factoring in ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, ozone, time decay, relative humidity, and temperature influences.
•	Develop a simulated respiratory system for producing secondhand smoke and mimicking aerosol deposition akin to the human respiratory system.
•	Established a chamber specifically for bioaerosol generation.
•	Evaluated pathogen viability within bioaerosols using a combination of culture and qPCR techniques.
•	Demonstrated size-dependent effect of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, more markedly reducing the normalized viability of E. coli in smaller-sized (0.25 – 0.5 μm) bioaerosols compared to larger ones (0.5 – 2.5 μm).
•	Identified three filter media producing deposition efficiencies closely aligned with three human respiratory system regions across a broad submicron size spectrum.
•	Technologies Utilized: Sioutas Cascade Impactor; Gelatin filter; SKC BioSampler; 6 Jet Refillable Collison Nebulizer; Bacterial culture methods; qPCR molecular science; Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry.
