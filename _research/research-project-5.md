Utilized a comprehensive dataset collected for six years by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) in the Southern Great Plains (SGP) of Oklahoma, USA, and analyzed it with a focus on different seasons and years.
Identified the NPF occurrence using data collected from surface measurements and developed a random forest algorithm to determine the influence and relevance of atmospheric variables on the occurrence of NPF events. 
This random forest approach yielded predictions of these events with an accuracy ranging from 95 to 100%. Our results indicate that RH is the main factor that influences the occurrence of NPF. 
There are higher and similar frequencies of NPF occurrence in spring, fall, and winter seasons at the SGP, while the NPF frequency is lower in the summer.
