excerpt: "<div>
    <p>This study employs machine learning to predict New Particle Formation (NPF) events, crucial for understanding climate and air quality. Analyzing data from the Southern Great Plains over six years, we identified key atmospheric influencers of NPF. Our approach, combining random forest and neural networks, accurately forecasts NPF events, offering advancements in atmospheric aerosol research.</p>

## Goals
- Utilize machine learning to forecast New Particle Formation (NPF) events, enhancing our understanding of their impact on climate and air quality.
- Identify and analyze key atmospheric variables influencing NPF events through extensive data analysis.

## Key Findings
- **Dominant Influence of Relative Humidity**: Identified relative humidity as the primary atmospheric factor affecting NPF occurrence, supported by machine learning analysis.
- **Seasonal Variation in NPF Frequency**: Detected higher frequencies of NPF events in spring, fall, and winter, with lower occurrences in summer, indicating significant seasonal impacts.
- **High Prediction Accuracy**: Achieved NPF event prediction accuracies between 95 to 100% using a random forest algorithm, demonstrating the effectiveness of ML in atmospheric studies.
- **ML Algorithms' Efficacy**: The integration of random forest and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks has significantly advanced the predictive modeling capabilities for NPF events.
