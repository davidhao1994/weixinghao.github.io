•	Examined the performance of alcohol-based and water-based CPCs through numerical simulation.
•	Understood the effects of varying operating conditions (temperature, flow rate, inlet pressure, geometry) and working fluids on CPC performance.
•	Employed COMSOL software for comprehensive numerical simulations of CPCs and post-processing of MATLAB.
•	Incorporated particle activation and droplet growth within the simulations.
•	Identified that lowering the condenser temperature, reducing the diameter of the condenser tube and using a lower aerosol flow rate through the capillary can enhance the activation of sub-3 nm particles.
•	Observed that droplet growth reduction becomes pronounced under low-pressure scenarios, potentially impacting counting efficiency.
•	Offered insights beneficial for future adjustments and enhancements in CPCs tailored to sub-3 nm particle detection.
•	Provided guidance for optimizing vWCPC performance, especially for precise particle detection and atmospheric aerosol monitoring.
•	Technologies Utilized: COMSOL Multiphysics simulation coupled with MATLAB.
