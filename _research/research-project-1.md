## **Filtration performances of household materials as candidates for facemasks**
•	Investigated the filtration performance of common materials for potential use as filters in 3D-printed respirators and DIY facemasks during the COVID-19 pandemic.
•	Determined the factors influencing the filtration performance of homemade face masks.
•	Evaluated the filtration efficiency of over 250 different non-medical and fabric materials and freely shared with the public.
•	Assessed the breathability of each material to ensure user comfort.
•	Achieved similar N95 filtration efficiency using multiple layers of household air filters without significant flow resistance increase.
•	Recommended manufacturing homemade facemasks with a combination of fibrous and fabric materials to guarantee the sufficient removal of aerosols.
•	Determined that washing and drying showed good reusability for fabric materials.
•	Boosted filtration performance with triboelectric charging, but its fleeting effect due to charge dissipation suggests limited utility in homemade face coverings.
•	Captured significant media attention from leading outlets such as the New York Times, BBC News, NPR News, etc.
•	Technologies Utilized: Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer; Aerodynamic Particle Sizer; Condensation particle Counter; Constant Output Atomizer; Air Sampling Cassette; Scanning Electron Microscope; Manometer; Digital Microscope.
