Goals:
• Investigate the filtration performance of common materials for potential use as
filters in 3D-printed respirators and DIY facemasks during the COVID-19 pandemic.
• Determine the factors influencing the filtration performance of homemade face
masks.

Methods and Results:
• Evaluated the filtration efficiency of over 250 different non-medical and fabric
materials and freely shared with the public.
• Assessed the breathability of each material to ensure user comfort.
• Achieved similar N95 filtration efficiency using multiple layers of household air
filters without significant flow resistance increase.
• Recommended manufacturing homemade facemasks with a combination of fibrous
and fabric materials to guarantee the sufficient removal of aerosols.
• Determined that washing and drying showed good reusability for fabric materials.
• Boosted filtration performance with triboelectric charging, but its fleeting effect due
to charge dissipation suggests limited utility in homemade face coverings.
• Captured significant media attention from leading outlets such as the New York
Times, BBC News, NPR News, etc

Technologies Utilized: 
Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer; Aerodynamic Particle Sizer; Condensation particle Counter; Constant Output Atomizer; Air Sampling Cassette; Scanning Electron Microscope; Manometer; Digital Microscope.
