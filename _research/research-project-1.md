excerpt: "<div>
    <p>This study examined over 250 non-medical and fabric materials for use in DIY masks and 3D-printed respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on filtration efficiency and breathability. Achievements include N95-level efficiency with household air filters, optimal material combinations for aerosol removal, and fabric reusability through washing. Triboelectric charging briefly enhanced filtration but was considered impractical for long-term use. The research gained significant media attention, underscoring its impact on public health practices during the pandemic.</p>

## Goals
- Investigate the filtration performance of common materials for potential use as
filters in 3D-printed respirators and DIY facemasks during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Determine the factors influencing the filtration performance of homemade face
masks.

## Key Findings
- **N95-Level Efficiency**: Achieved with multiple layers of household air filters, maintaining breathability.
- **Optimal Material Combinations**: A blend of fibrous and fabric materials is recommended for effective aerosol removal.
- **Fabric Reusability**: Materials maintained filtration efficiency after washing and drying, supporting sustainable practices.
- **Triboelectric Charging**: Provided a temporary boost in filtration performance, though its practicality for long-term use is limited.

## Media Attention
The study's implications for public health during the pandemic attracted attention from leading media outlets, including the New York Times, BBC News, and NPR News.
