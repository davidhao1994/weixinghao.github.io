## **Understanding the evolution and transport of indoor bioaerosols**
* Understand the viability of bioaerosols based on their sizes in indoor environments, factoring in ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, ozone, time decay, relative humidity, and temperature influences.
* Develop a simulated respiratory system for producing secondhand smoke and mimicking aerosol deposition akin to the human respiratory system.
* Established a chamber specifically for bioaerosol generation.
* Evaluated pathogen viability within bioaerosols using a combination of culture and qPCR techniques.
* Demonstrated size-dependent effect of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, more markedly reducing the normalized viability of E. coli in smaller-sized (0.25 – 0.5 μm) bioaerosols compared to larger ones (0.5 – 2.5 μm).
* Identified three filter media producing deposition efficiencies closely aligned with three human respiratory system regions across a broad submicron size spectrum.
* Technologies Utilized: Sioutas Cascade Impactor; Gelatin filter; SKC BioSampler; 6 Jet Refillable Collison Nebulizer; Bacterial culture methods; qPCR molecular science; Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry.
