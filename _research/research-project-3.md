excerpt: "This study investigates the viability and control of bioaerosols in indoor environments, with a focus on understanding how factors such as ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, ozone, temperature, and humidity influence the decay of airborne pathogens. Utilizing advanced techniques like the Sioutas Cascade Impactor and qPCR. Our findings reveal a size-dependent efficacy of UV irradiation on reducing *E. coli* viability, particularly in smaller bioaerosols. This research provides critical insights into optimizing indoor air quality controls to mitigate the transmission of respiratory pathogens."

## Goals
- Analyze the decay dynamics of microorganisms in bioaerosols based on time, size, and environmental conditions.
- Investigate the influence of indoor environmental factors and intervention strategies on bioaerosol behavior.
- Develop a computational fluid dynamics model to optimize indoor air quality controls and reduce infection risks from bioaerosols.

## Key Findings
- **Size-Dependent UV Efficacy**: Smaller bioaerosols (0.25 – 0.5 μm) were more effectively neutralized by UV irradiation compared to larger ones (0.5 – 2.5 μm).
- **Environmental Impact on Viability**: Highlighted the significant role of environmental factors in the survival and decay of pathogens within bioaerosols.

## Technologies Utilized

- Gelatin filter
- SKC BioSampler
- 6 Jet Refillable Collison Nebulizer
- Bacterial culture methods
- qPCR molecular science

* Understand the viability of bioaerosols based on their sizes in indoor environments, factoring in ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, ozone, time decay, relative humidity, and temperature influences.
* Develop a simulated respiratory system for producing secondhand smoke and mimicking aerosol deposition akin to the human respiratory system.
* Established a chamber specifically for bioaerosol generation.
* Evaluated pathogen viability within bioaerosols using a combination of culture and qPCR techniques.
* Demonstrated size-dependent effect of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, more markedly reducing the normalized viability of E. coli in smaller-sized (0.25 – 0.5 μm) bioaerosols compared to larger ones (0.5 – 2.5 μm).
* Identified three filter media producing deposition efficiencies closely aligned with three human respiratory system regions across a broad submicron size spectrum.
* Technologies Utilized: Sioutas Cascade Impactor; Gelatin filter; SKC BioSampler; 6 Jet Refillable Collison Nebulizer; Bacterial culture methods; qPCR molecular science; Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry.

Respiratory pathogens have tremendous public health impact and cause large economic losses. In the US, the annual economic burden of influenza alone is more than $11.2 billion. Among transmission modes of viral and bacterial respiratory diseases, airborne transmission is not well understood. In this mode, microorganisms are contained in droplet nuclei, forming bioaerosols, and thus can be suspended in the air for a longer time, causing higher exposure and infection risks. In the medical field, aerosol transmission is still thought to “reflect a modern understanding of aerosol science,” which requires more fundamental studies. The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 further highlights the urgent need to understand the transport and evolution of pathogen-containing aerosols, as there is contradictory evidence and conclusions on the potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via the airborne mode. In this NSF-funded project, our objectives are to 1) examine the decay of microorganisms in bioaerosols as a function of time, bioaerosol size, and environmental conditions; 2) characterize the evolution and transport of indoor bioaerosols under different ventilation configurations; and 3) establish a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model coupled with bioaerosol evolution to optimize intervention strategies to reduce the infection risk of indoor bioaerosols.
