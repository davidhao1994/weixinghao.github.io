excerpt: "<div>
    <p>This study investigates the viability and control of bioaerosols in indoor environments, with a focus on understanding how factors such as ultraviolet germicidal irradiation(UVGI), ozone, temperature, and humidity influence the decay of airborne pathogens. Our findings reveal a size-dependent efficacy of UVGI in reducing *E. coli* viability, particularly in smaller bioaerosols. This research provides critical insights into optimizing indoor air quality controls to mitigate the transmission of respiratory pathogens.</p>

## Goals
- Analyze the decay dynamics of microorganisms in bioaerosols based on time, size, and environmental conditions.
- Investigate the influence of indoor environmental factors and intervention strategies on bioaerosol behavior.
- Develop a computational fluid dynamics model to optimize indoor air quality controls and reduce infection risks from bioaerosols.

## Key Findings
- **Size-Dependent UV Efficacy**: Smaller bioaerosols (0.25 – 0.5 μm) were more effectively neutralized by UV irradiation compared to larger ones (0.5 – 2.5 μm).
- **Environmental Impact on Viability**: Highlighted the significant role of environmental factors in the survival and decay of pathogens within bioaerosols.
